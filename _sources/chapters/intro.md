Molass Library is a rewrite of [MOLASS](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/biophysico/20/1/20_e200001/_article) which is an analytical tool for SEC-SAXS experiment data currently hosted at [Photon Factory](https://pfwww.kek.jp/saxs/MOLASS.html), Japan. It is designed for scripting in Jupyter notebooks, thereby attaining greater flexibility compared to the predecessor thanks to the Python ecosystem diversity.

This document describes the theoretical essence of the library. You can read the chapters of the left sidebar in order. Otherwise, glance over the contents or use the search box to find what you are interested in.
