    "# Linear Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix multiplication maps any vector to another vector. Therefore it maps a shape to another shape in the vector space. In this sense a matrix correspond to a transformation, which is called a linear transformation. In this chapter, we will explore some examples in the hope that it will be helpful for the understanding of linear algebra basics."
